# Item Editor Qt6 Migration Workflow

This document outlines the workflow for migrating the Item Editor application from C# to Qt6.

## 1. Understand the Legacy Application

* **Goal:** Gain a deep understanding of the C# application's functionality, architecture, and user interface.
* **Actions:**
    * Thoroughly read `Legacy_App/csharp/Source/`.
    * Pay close attention to `MainForm.cs` to understand the main application logic.
    * Study the custom controls in `Legacy_App/csharp/Source/Controls/`.
    * Analyze the dialogs in `Legacy_App/csharp/Source/Dialogs/` to understand their functionality.
    * Understand the plugin system by reviewing `Legacy_App/csharp/Source/PluginInterface/` and the existing plugin implementations.

## 2. Analyze the Qt6 Project

* **Goal:** Assess the current state of the Qt6 migration.
* **Actions:**
    * Review the existing Qt6 source code in `qt6_project/src/`.
    * Identify which components have been migrated and which are still missing.
    * Look for any `TODO`, `FIXME`, or other comments indicating incomplete work.
    * Build and run the Qt6 application to see its current state.

## 3. Gap Analysis and Planning

* **Goal:** Create a detailed plan for the migration.
* **Actions:**
    * Compare the C# and Qt6 codebases to identify all missing features and functionality.
    * Create a prioritized list of migration tasks.
    * For each task, create a detailed implementation plan.
    * Use the `set_plan` tool to document the plan.

## 4. Component Migration

* **Goal:** Migrate individual components from C# to Qt6.
* **Actions:**
    * For each component, create the necessary C++ header and source files in the corresponding `qt6_project/src/` directory.
    * Translate the C# code to C++/Qt6, following the guidelines in `qt6_project/docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`.
    * Use Qt's features, such as signals and slots, layouts, and the model/view framework, where appropriate.
    * Ensure that the migrated component has the same functionality as the original C# component.

## 5. Testing and Verification

* **Goal:** Ensure that the migrated code is correct and bug-free.
* **Actions:**
    * Write unit tests for the migrated components.
    * Perform integration testing to ensure that the components work together correctly.
    * Manually test the application to verify that it behaves as expected.
    * Test with all supported file formats (.otb, .dat, .spr, .xml).

## 6. Iteration and Refinement

* **Goal:** Continuously improve the migrated codebase.
* **Actions:**
    * Refactor the code to improve its quality and maintainability.
    * Address any bugs or issues that are found during testing.
    * Update the documentation as needed.

## 7. Finalization

* **Goal:** Prepare the application for release.
* **Actions:**
    * Remove all placeholder code and comments.
    * Ensure that the application is stable and ready for production use.
    * Create a final build of the application.
    * Submit the final code with a comprehensive commit message.
