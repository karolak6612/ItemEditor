# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the Legacy ItemEditor application from .NET Framework 4.8 with Windows Forms to a modern .NET 9 application using WPF and WPFUI. The migration must achieve 100% functional parity while modernizing the technology stack and implementing a contemporary user interface design. The ItemEditor is a specialized tool for editing OpenTibia Binary (OTB) files, sprites, and data files used in OpenTibia server development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Functional Parity

**User Story:** As an OpenTibia server developer, I want all existing ItemEditor functionality to work identically in the new application, so that I can continue my workflow without any disruption or learning curve.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens any .otb, .dat, or .spr file THEN the system SHALL load and display the file with identical parsing and rendering as the legacy application
2. WHEN the user performs any item editing operation THEN the system SHALL maintain identical behavior, validation, and output as the legacy version
3. WHEN the user uses any plugin functionality THEN the system SHALL provide identical plugin interface compatibility and behavior
4. WHEN the user saves any file THEN the system SHALL produce output files that are byte-for-byte identical to the legacy application
5. WHEN the user performs any comparison operation THEN the system SHALL provide identical comparison results and visualization

### Requirement 2: Modern Technology Stack Migration

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the ItemEditor, I want the application built on modern .NET 9 technology, so that I can leverage current development practices, performance improvements, and long-term support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL target .NET 9 framework with modern C# language features
2. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL use WPF with WPFUI for the user interface framework
3. WHEN the application performs file operations THEN the system SHALL use modern async/await patterns throughout
4. WHEN the application handles dependencies THEN the system SHALL use Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection for dependency injection
5. WHEN the application processes data THEN the system SHALL leverage .NET 9 performance improvements and modern patterns

### Requirement 3: Contemporary User Interface Design

**User Story:** As a user of the ItemEditor, I want a modern, beautiful interface that follows current design standards, so that I have an improved user experience while maintaining familiar workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application launches THEN the system SHALL display a modern WPF interface using WPFUI design system
2. WHEN the user interacts with controls THEN the system SHALL provide Fluent Design elements with proper theming support
3. WHEN the user switches themes THEN the system SHALL support both light and dark themes with automatic system theme detection
4. WHEN the user navigates the interface THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions and modern interaction patterns
5. WHEN the user views dialogs THEN the system SHALL display modern modal windows with contemporary styling

### Requirement 4: Plugin System Modernization

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want the plugin system to work with modern .NET patterns while maintaining compatibility, so that existing plugins continue to work and new plugins can leverage modern features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing plugins are loaded THEN the system SHALL maintain 100% backward compatibility with current plugin interfaces
2. WHEN the plugin system initializes THEN the system SHALL use modern dependency injection for plugin services
3. WHEN plugins are managed THEN the system SHALL provide modern assembly loading with proper isolation
4. WHEN plugin errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide enhanced error handling and logging
5. WHEN new plugins are developed THEN the system SHALL support modern async patterns in plugin interfaces

### Requirement 5: File Format Compatibility

**User Story:** As an OpenTibia developer, I want complete compatibility with all existing file formats, so that I can continue working with my existing data files without any conversion or compatibility issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN .otb files are processed THEN the system SHALL maintain identical parsing, editing, and saving capabilities
2. WHEN .dat files are handled THEN the system SHALL preserve exact item definition processing and output
3. WHEN .spr files are managed THEN the system SHALL maintain identical sprite rendering and manipulation
4. WHEN file operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use modern I/O patterns while preserving exact file format compatibility
5. WHEN large files are processed THEN the system SHALL provide progress indication and cancellation support

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Performance and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a user working with large item databases, I want improved performance and responsive UI, so that I can work efficiently with large datasets without application freezing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN large files are loaded THEN the system SHALL provide non-blocking UI with progress indication
2. WHEN item lists are displayed THEN the system SHALL implement efficient virtualization for large datasets
3. WHEN images are rendered THEN the system SHALL use modern graphics APIs for improved performance
4. WHEN file operations execute THEN the system SHALL provide cancellation capabilities for long-running operations
5. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL have startup performance equal to or better than the legacy version

### Requirement 7: Modern Development Practices

**User Story:** As a developer contributing to the ItemEditor, I want the codebase to follow modern development practices, so that the application is maintainable, testable, and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is architected THEN the system SHALL implement MVVM pattern with proper separation of concerns
2. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL use nullable reference types and modern C# features
3. WHEN services are implemented THEN the system SHALL use dependency injection with proper service abstractions
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL use structured logging with Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
5. WHEN the application is tested THEN the system SHALL support comprehensive unit and integration testing

### Requirement 8: Deployment and Distribution

**User Story:** As an end user, I want easy installation and deployment of the modern ItemEditor, so that I can quickly get the application running on my system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is distributed THEN the system SHALL provide modern deployment packages for Windows
2. WHEN the application is installed THEN the system SHALL require only .NET 9 runtime as a dependency
3. WHEN the application updates THEN the system SHALL support modern update mechanisms
4. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL be compatible with Windows 10 and Windows 11
5. WHEN deployment occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain identical file associations and integration points

### Requirement 9: Data Migration and Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing ItemEditor user, I want seamless migration of my settings and data, so that I don't lose any configuration or customization when upgrading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new application first runs THEN the system SHALL automatically migrate existing user settings and preferences
2. WHEN plugins are loaded THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing plugin configurations
3. WHEN recent files are accessed THEN the system SHALL preserve recent file history and bookmarks
4. WHEN custom configurations exist THEN the system SHALL migrate all user customizations and preferences
5. WHEN the migration completes THEN the system SHALL provide feedback on successful migration status

### Requirement 10: Quality Assurance and Testing

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing capabilities to ensure the migration maintains perfect compatibility, so that users can trust the new application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compatibility testing is performed THEN the system SHALL pass 100% of legacy functionality tests
2. WHEN file format testing occurs THEN the system SHALL produce identical output for all test cases
3. WHEN performance testing is conducted THEN the system SHALL meet or exceed legacy application performance benchmarks
4. WHEN plugin testing is executed THEN the system SHALL maintain 100% compatibility with existing plugin test suites
5. WHEN regression testing is performed THEN the system SHALL pass all automated test scenarios without failures
