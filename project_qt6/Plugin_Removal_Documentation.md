# Qt6 Plugin System Removal Documentation

## Overview
This document records the systematic removal of the broken Qt6 plugin system from the ItemEditor project as part of Task 3 in the C# to Qt6 migration.

## Reason for Removal
The current Qt6 plugin implementation was identified as broken and needs to be completely replaced with a proper implementation based on the C# plugin architecture analysis.

## Files Backed Up
All plugin files have been backed up to `project_qt6/plugins_backup/` before removal:

### Plugin Interface Files
- `iplugin.h` - Plugin interface definition and PluginManager class
- `iplugin.cpp` - PluginManager implementation with dynamic loading

### Plugin Implementations  
- `dummyplugin.h/.cpp/.json` - Dummy plugin implementation
- `realplugin770.h/.cpp/.json` - Tibia 7.70 plugin implementation
- `realplugin860.h/.cpp/.json` - Tibia 8.60+ plugin implementation

## Code Patterns to Preserve

### Useful Patterns from Current Implementation
1. **Plugin Interface Structure**: The IPlugin abstract interface provides a good foundation
2. **SupportedClient Management**: Client version and signature handling
3. **Dynamic Loading Framework**: QPluginLoader usage pattern
4. **Error Handling**: Plugin loading error detection and reporting

### OTB Handling Code (PRESERVE)
- OTB reading/writing functionality should be preserved as it may contain working code
- Item data structures and enums should be maintained
- Binary tree handling should be kept

## Removal Plan

### Phase 1: Remove Plugin System Integration
1. Remove plugin includes from mainwindow.h/cpp
2. Remove PluginManager usage from MainWindow
3. Remove plugin-related UI elements and menu items
4. Clean up plugin references in dialogs

### Phase 2: Remove Plugin Files
1. Delete plugin implementation files
2. Remove plugin entries from CMakeLists.txt
3. Clean up plugin directory

### Phase 3: Clean Up Dependencies
1. Remove plugin-related includes throughout codebase
2. Update CMake configuration
3. Ensure OTB functionality remains intact

## Files to be Modified

### MainWindow Changes
- `mainwindow.h`: Remove PluginManager* and IPlugin* members
- `mainwindow.cpp`: Remove plugin initialization and usage

### CMakeLists.txt Changes
- Remove plugin source files from build
- Remove plugin include directories if no longer needed

### Dialog Changes
- `preferencesdialog.h/.cpp`: Remove plugin-related functionality
- `updateotbdialog.h/.cpp`: Remove plugin dependencies

## Post-Removal Verification
After removal, verify:
1. Project compiles without plugin system
2. OTB file handling remains functional
3. UI loads without plugin-related errors
4. No broken references to plugin code

## Next Steps
After successful removal:
1. Implement new plugin system based on C# architecture analysis
2. Recreate plugin interface matching C# IPlugin contract
3. Implement proper plugin discovery and loading
4. Migrate existing plugin functionality to new system

## Backup Location
Complete backup of removed files: `project_qt6/plugins_backup/`
