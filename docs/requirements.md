# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for migrating the legacy ItemEditor application from a Windows Forms/.NET Framework 4.6.1 C# application to a modern cross-platform framework. ItemEditor is a specialized tool for editing OTB (Open Tibia Binary) data files used in game development, supporting versions 8.00-10.77. The application features a plugin-based architecture, dark UI theme, and comprehensive item editing capabilities including sprite visualization, attribute management, and data validation.

The migration must achieve 100% functional and experiential parity with the legacy system while modernizing the technology stack for improved maintainability, cross-platform compatibility, and future extensibility.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening an OTB file THEN the system SHALL read and parse the file using the exact same binary format interpretation as the legacy system
2. WHEN displaying server items THEN the system SHALL show identical item lists, filtering, and sorting capabilities
3. WHEN saving OTB files THEN the system SHALL write binary data that is byte-for-byte identical to the legacy system output
4. WHEN creating new OTB files THEN the system SHALL generate files with the same structure and default values as the legacy system
5. WHEN handling unsupported OTB versions THEN the system SHALL display the exact same error messages and fallback behavior
6. WHEN loading items.xml files THEN the system SHALL parse and apply the data using identical logic to the legacy system

### Requirement 3: Item Editing and Attribute Management

**User Story:** As a game content creator, I want to edit item properties and attributes with pixel-perfect accuracy to the legacy interface, so that my editing experience remains consistent and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting an item THEN the system SHALL display all item properties in the identical layout and format as the legacy system
2. WHEN modifying item attributes THEN the system SHALL validate and apply changes using the exact same business logic
3. WHEN comparing server and client items THEN the system SHALL highlight mismatches using the identical color coding and visual indicators
4. WHEN creating new items THEN the system SHALL assign IDs and initialize properties using the same algorithms as the legacy system
5. WHEN duplicating items THEN the system SHALL copy all properties and maintain the same ID assignment logic
6. WHEN reloading item data THEN the system SHALL refresh properties using identical synchronization logic with client data

### Requirement 4: Plugin System and Client Data Integration

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the plugin system to load and manage client data (DAT/SPR files) with identical behavior to the legacy system, so that all supported game versions continue to work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading client plugins THEN the system SHALL discover and initialize plugins using the same directory scanning and reflection logic
2. WHEN validating DAT/SPR signatures THEN the system SHALL use identical signature checking algorithms and error handling
3. WHEN loading sprite data THEN the system SHALL parse and cache sprites using the same memory management and hash calculation methods
4. WHEN comparing sprite signatures THEN the system SHALL use the identical Fourier transform and Euclidean distance algorithms for similarity matching
5. WHEN handling plugin errors THEN the system SHALL display the same error messages and recovery options as the legacy system

### Requirement 5: User Interface and Visual Fidelity

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the migrated application to look and behave identically to the legacy system, so that I can continue using the tool without relearning the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display the exact same dark theme colors, fonts, and visual styling
2. WHEN interacting with controls THEN the system SHALL provide identical hover effects, focus indicators, and state changes
3. WHEN opening dialogs THEN the system SHALL show forms with pixel-perfect layout matching the legacy system
4. WHEN displaying item sprites THEN the system SHALL render images with identical transparency, scaling, and positioning
5. WHEN showing tooltips and status information THEN the system SHALL display the same text content and formatting
6. WHEN resizing windows THEN the system SHALL maintain the same responsive behavior and minimum size constraints

### Requirement 6: Data Validation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a data integrity specialist, I want all validation rules and error handling to behave identically to the legacy system, so that data quality and user feedback remain consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating item properties THEN the system SHALL apply the exact same validation rules and constraints
2. WHEN encountering file format errors THEN the system SHALL display identical error messages and recovery options
3. WHEN handling memory or resource constraints THEN the system SHALL use the same error handling and cleanup procedures
4. WHEN detecting data corruption THEN the system SHALL provide the same diagnostic information and repair suggestions
5. WHEN logging system events THEN the system SHALL write identical log entries with the same format and detail level

### Requirement 7: Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious user, I want the migrated system to maintain or improve upon the legacy system's performance characteristics, so that large datasets continue to be handled efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading large OTB files THEN the system SHALL complete loading within the same time bounds as the legacy system
2. WHEN displaying item lists THEN the system SHALL maintain the same scrolling performance and memory usage patterns
3. WHEN calculating sprite hashes THEN the system SHALL use algorithms that produce identical results with comparable or better performance
4. WHEN managing plugin lifecycle THEN the system SHALL use the same memory allocation and cleanup patterns
5. WHEN handling concurrent operations THEN the system SHALL maintain the same thread safety and synchronization behavior

### Requirement 8: Cross-Platform Compatibility and Modern Framework Integration

**User Story:** As a deployment manager, I want the migrated application to run on multiple platforms while maintaining identical functionality, so that the tool can be used across different development environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Windows THEN the system SHALL provide 100% functional parity with the legacy Windows Forms application
2. WHEN running on macOS or Linux THEN the system SHALL provide equivalent functionality with platform-appropriate UI adaptations
3. WHEN using modern framework features THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing plugin interfaces
4. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL support the same installation and configuration methods as the legacy system
5. WHEN integrating with system services THEN the system SHALL maintain the same file association and shell integration capabilities where supported

### Requirement 9: Configuration and Settings Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want application settings and preferences to be managed identically to the legacy system, so that existing configurations can be preserved and migrated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN saving user preferences THEN the system SHALL store settings using compatible formats that can be read by both systems
3. WHEN managing plugin configurations THEN the system SHALL maintain the same configuration file structures and validation rules
4. WHEN handling environment variables THEN the system SHALL process and apply them using identical logic to the legacy system
